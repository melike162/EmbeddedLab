# STM32 Door Control with PIR and LCD Display

This project demonstrates **automatic door control** using the **STM32F407VGT6** microcontroller.  
It integrates a **PIR motion sensor**, **servo motor**, **LED indicator**, and a **16x2 LCD** to visualize door status and count the number of openings.

## üìÅ Project Contents

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ STM32 CubeIDE Code (`cubeide_door`)
- Reads **motion from PIR sensor** connected to **PA0**.
- Controls **servo motor** via **PE9** using **TIM1_CH1** to open/close the door.
- Turns on an **LED on PD12** while the door is opening and keeps it on when the door is open.
- Uses a **16x2 LCD** with the following connections:
  - **VSS ‚Üí GND**
  - **VDD ‚Üí 5V**
  - **V0 ‚Üí Potentiometer middle pin** (for contrast)
  - **RS ‚Üí PA1**
  - **RW ‚Üí PA2**
  - **E ‚Üí PA3**
  - **D4 ‚Üí PA4**
  - **D5 ‚Üí PA5**
  - **D6 ‚Üí PA6**
  - **D7 ‚Üí PA7**
- Displays messages such as `"HELLO WORLD"`, `"DOOR IS OPENING/CLOSING"`, and the **number of times the door has opened**.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Connect all components according to the pinout described above.
2. Compile and upload the project in CubeIDE.
3. When motion is detected by the PIR sensor (**PA0**):
   - Servo motor (**PE9**) moves to open the door.
   - LED on **PD12** turns on.
   - LCD displays `"DOOR IS OPENING"`.
4. When motion stops:
   - Servo moves the door to close.
   - LED on **PD12** turns off.
   - LCD displays `"DOOR IS CLOSING"`.
5. The LCD also shows the **total number of times the door has opened**.
